git:
Step 1: Open Terminal in Your Project Directory
Note: Make sure youâ€™re in the root directory of your project (travel-weather).

Step 2: Add Changes to Git
Run the following command to stage all your changes:

git add .


Step 3: Commit the Changes
Commit the staged changes with a meaningful commit message:

git commit -m "Corrected time and added new features"


Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub
Push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub. If you have set up the remote already (from a previous session), you can use:

git push 


Note: If your branch is named something other than main, replace main with your branch name.
